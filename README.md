# Hi, I'm Gregory Salinas ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Senior Software Engineer at Procore Technologies, where I contribute to the Marketing Web Team. I'm passionate about crafting elegant and efficient web solutions, and I thrive in collaborative environments.

## What I'm working on

Currently, I'm deeply involved in developing **Spark CSS**, a comprehensive library of Tailwind CSS themes designed to empower developers to build beautifully styled components with libraries such as Ark UI and Radix UI.  Spark CSS aims to streamline the process of creating consistent and accessible user interfaces, providing a solid foundation for rapid development and customization.  I'm excited about the potential of Spark CSS to simplify UI development and improve the overall user experience.

## My interests

Beyond coding, I'm very passionate about exploring the natural beauty of California, from the coast to the mountains! I'm always eager to learn new technologies and explore different approaches to problem-solving.  I believe in continuous improvement and am constantly seeking opportunities to expand my skillset.
